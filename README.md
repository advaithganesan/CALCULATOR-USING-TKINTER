# CALCULATOR-USING-TKINTER
In this Task i have started the code by importing the tkinter module and renaming it as tk for convenience.
Created he Main Window, root.title() and root.geometry() functions set the title and size of the window, respectively.
Creating the Entry Field: The width, font, borderwidth, relief, and justify parameters are used to customize the appearance of the entry field.
Global Variable expression
press(num) updates the expression variable and displays the current expression in the entry field.
used clear() and equal() Function
created a Button Layout
Created and Placed the Buttons using the grid() method. The command parameter specifies the function to be called when the button is clicked.
Running the Application: The root.mainloop() function starts the main event loop, which keeps the application running and responds to user interactions.
In summary, I have created a calculator application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library in Python. Users can enter expressions, clear the entry field, and evaluate the expressions using the buttons provided.
